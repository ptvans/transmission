            <p>Transport: Transitioning from an oil-based to a low-carbon transportation system could save up to $3.5 trillion depending on policy choices; a combination of innovation and policies that reduce demand work better than policies that restrict supply.</p>

            <p>The fossil-fuel value at risk from a low-carbon transition represents only 2-3% of the total value held by the owners of potentially stranded assets. Further, the largest share belongs to governments, who own over half of global fossil fuel production and control as much as 70% of oil and gas production through companies that are wholly or majority owned by governments. As governments control much of the policy that may lead to stranding, they can reduce impact and recover lost value through policy.</p>
            <!--<p>But innovation is a phenomenon that is difficult to predict and influence.  If innovation doesn’t pull us toward a renewable future by making the technology more viable, then we may resort to taxation. It turns out that the government is a huge stakeholder.  They own and invest in much fossil production capacity around the world, meaning that their decisions will largely influence how we make this transition. As major stakeholders, national governments simultaneously wield enormous influence and high exposure to risks.

            <h1>Transitioning away from coal offers the most cost-effective opportunity for a low-carbon transition</h1>
            <p>the global community can achieve approximately 80% of necessary carbon reductions by transitioning away from coal for 12% of global economic value at risk. In the power sector, the U.S. and EU are already on track for a transition with minimal economic value loss; China and India would have to find alternatives to new coal plants to minimize the cost of transition to a low-carbon economy.</p>

            <h2>Coal fired power generation is still the defacto growth model in the developing world.</h2>
            <p>To be consistent with a 450ppm limit, these developing countries need to halt their development beyond the threshold.  These growing economies have a tremendous opportunity to get energy development right the first time and then reap the benefits for decades to come. Continuing on a path of Coal will result in wasteful invesment, as new coal plants will simply be competing for emissions quotas with existing plants. Current investment will be future stranded asset costs that need to be written off as plants are shut down.  Those investment dollars could be used much more efficiently in alternative renewables.</p>

            <h2>Simply achieving longer loan terms will have a large impact</h2>
            <p> In emerging economies with high debt costs, concessional debt or indexing renewable energy support to foreign currency could reduce costs by as much as 30%. Here are a few things that work to improve things. Debt costs and terms are the main driver of higher finance costs in the developing world.</p>
