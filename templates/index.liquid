            <p>Transport: Transitioning from an oil-based to a low-carbon transportation system could save up to $3.5 trillion depending on policy choices; a combination of innovation and policies that reduce demand work better than policies that restrict supply.</p>

            <p>The fossil-fuel value at risk from a low-carbon transition represents only 2-3% of the total value held by the owners of potentially stranded assets. Further, the largest share belongs to governments, who own over half of global fossil fuel production and control as much as 70% of oil and gas production through companies that are wholly or majority owned by governments. As governments control much of the policy that may lead to stranding, they can reduce impact and recover lost value through policy.</p>
            <!--<p>But innovation is a phenomenon that is difficult to predict and influence.  If innovation doesn’t pull us toward a renewable future by making the technology more viable, then we may resort to taxation. It turns out that the government is a huge stakeholder.  They own and invest in much fossil production capacity around the world, meaning that their decisions will largely influence how we make this transition. As major stakeholders, national governments simultaneously wield enormous influence and high exposure to risks.
