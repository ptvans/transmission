                <p>Power: The transition to a low-carbon electricity system can save the global economy $1.8 trillion over the next twenty years.</p>
                <p>Transport: Transitioning from oil to low-carbon transport could result in further savings of up to $3.5 trillion depending on policy choices; a combination of innovation and policies that reduce demand work better than policies that restrict supply.</p>

                <p> Regions that import more oil than they produce — including the United States, Europe, China, and India — can see trillions in gains to their economies over the next 20 years from reducing their oil consumption in favor of low-carbon alternatives. They can benefit by transitioning to a low-carbon economy together even if net oil producing countries do not.</p>

                <p>The fossil-fuel value at risk from a low-carbon transition represents only 2-3% of the total value held by the owners of potentially stranded assets. Further, the largest share belongs to governments, who own over half of global fossil fuel production and control as much as 70% of oil and gas production through companies that are wholly or majority owned by governments. As governments control much of the policy that may lead to stranding, they can reduce impact and recover lost value through policy.</p>
                <!--<p>But innovation is a phenomenon that is difficult to predict and influence.  If innovation doesn’t pull us toward a renewable future by making the technology more viable, then we may resort to taxation. It turns out that the government is a huge stakeholder.  They own and invest in much fossil production capacity around the world, meaning that their decisions will largely influence how we make this transition. As major stakeholders, national governments simultaneously wield enormous influence and high exposure to risks.

These growing economies have a tremendous opportunity to get energy development right the first time and then reap the benefits for decades to come. Continuing on a path of Coal will result in wasteful invesment, as new coal plants will simply be competing for emissions quotas with existing plants. Current investment will be future stranded asset costs that need to be written off as plants are shut down.  Those investment dollars could be used much more efficiently in alternative renewables.</p>
