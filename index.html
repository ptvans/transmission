                <p>But innovation is a phenomenon that is difficult to predict and influence.  If innovation doesn’t pull us toward a renewable future by making the technology more viable, then we may resort to taxation. It turns out that the government is a huge stakeholder.  They own and invest in much fossil production capacity around the world, meaning that their decisions will largely influence how we make this transition. As major stakeholders, national governments simultaneously wield enormous influence and high exposure to risks.

                <h2>What is taxation</h2>
                <p>Taxation is a tax on the consumption of fossil fuel products, making it more expensive and thus increasing the competitiveness of renewable energy sources.</p>

                <p>Oil consumers can act independently of oil producers to tax oil consumption.  Countries that consume more oil than they produce could see an economic boost because increased tax revenue would more than offset lost oil revenue due to higher prices.  If consumers do act alone, producers are better off joining them.</p>

These growing economies have a tremendous opportunity to get energy development right the first time and then reap the benefits for decades to come. Continuing on a path of Coal will result in wasteful invesment, as new coal plants will simply be competing for emissions quotas with existing plants. Current investment will be future stranded asset costs that need to be written off as plants are shut down.
